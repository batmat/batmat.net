Software Engineer, Build and Release
Job ID: 8155
Job Category: Software Engineering
Location:

 Job Summary
JBoss Developer Studio is an integral part of the JBoss application portfolio, as it provides developer tooling for many of the JBoss platforms. The IDE contains many different parts from different teams and as such is a massive release that needs a tremendous amount of coordination and integration between teams.

Just as Eclipse's annual release train gets longer every year, so too does the scope of our IDE grow. With this growth, we are looking to extend our team with a Build/Release Engineer to help manage the development and assembly of the IDE.

You will become part of the core JBoss Developer Studio team and will play an active part in  the JBoss Tools open source community. You will collaborate with developers from other JBoss projects and open source communities to make it possible to build a unified, consistent and reliable cross-platform IDE.
