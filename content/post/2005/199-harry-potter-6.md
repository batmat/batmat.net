**Note : Don't be afraid of reading this entry, I won't say what's going
on in this episode, so as not to waste a part of your pleasure in
reading...**

Don't try and find out now if you're still not aware of it... As I am
:-(. Even if this sixth is, as ever, a very enjoyable book to read apart
from it. It's thoroughly, woefully difficult to read it knowing this so
very important thing those stupid guys pointed out (beginning at /., I
think).

In fact, I'm reaching the 2 third (I'm not being precise on purpose) of
the book and I know that something terrible is gonna happend, and it
wastes a lot of my reading knowing it... What a pity... I will be
infinitely more careful when the seventh comes out, so as to preserve my
pleasure to discover this new, 'cause I'm sure it will be too, wonderful
story.
