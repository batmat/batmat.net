I have always been a tooling guy. Early in my carrier, now more than 10 years ago, I realized how much I love writing things making my life easier.

Automation for the win!

== Open Source

I have also always liked to be part of opensource communities. Sharing knowledge and helping others, learning a lot in the process. Participating in things like Hibernate documentation translation, Hibernate forum, Apache Maven mailing lists, MOJO @ CodeHaus (now link:http://www.mojohaus.org:[MojoHaus]) Continuum, Archiva, M2E, Sonar[Qube], Hudson, and... Jenkins.

After switching from Apache Continuum, I started using Jenkins around 2009 when it was named a bit differently. My first message on the users mailing list seems to link:https://java.net/projects/hudson/lists/users/archive/2010-02/message/623[date back to early 2010].

My first code contribution to Jenkins seems to date back to link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/commit/3c5c2c5cc335c1bb19c4e92bd4f75a715468dd33[2011], where I had to `git bisect` a weird issue we were probably only very few to have, as we were using IBM AIX at that time.

In 2012, I link:https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Build+Trigger+Badge+Plugin[published my first public plugin] with link:http://github.com/mpailloncy[MichaÃ«l].

Later, I took over the maintenance of some others, like the link:https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Radiator+View+Plugin[Radiator View Plugin], link:https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Parameterized+Scheduler+Plugin[Parameterized Scheduler Plugin] and most importantly the link:https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/ChuckNorris+Plugin[Chuck Norris Plugin].

About 2 years ago, I started participating in the link:https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Governance+Meeting+Agenda[Jenkins Governance Meetings on IRC].

== Full Time Jenkins!

All those years, I have been spending a fair amount of time on that project close to my heart. So, having the opportunity to work full-time in "a professional opensource company" on all-things-Jenkins is obviously something strongly motivating to me.

I am thrilled to say I will be joining CloudBees next August.

I am very proud to soon start working with so many great individuals, bringing my small contribution to smoothifying the software delivery process in our industry.
