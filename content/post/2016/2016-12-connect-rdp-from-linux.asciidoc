Working on validating the new Java 8 baseline of Jenkins, I needed some Windows environment to analyze some tests failure only happening there.
So, I went ahead to create an instance in Amazon Web Services to connect it to a Jenkins test instance.

It is actually pretty simple, but I thought I would explain it quickly here because it might help some people (like me next time) to save some minutes.

== Launching your instance

It is out of scope here as it has nothing specific to our current use case. Just create an instance.
I am using the `Microsoft Windows Server 2016 Base - ami-45e3ec52` for that article.

CAUTION: The only important thing is to make sure to keep the selected `.pem` file handy.
It will be necessary to retrieve the `Administrator` password once the instance is created.

Your instance is now running.

== Connect to it

* In the UI, right-click on the instance, then click Connect.

* Copy the `Public DNS` field value
* Open a command-line and connect using the `rdesktop` command:
[source,shell]
----
$ rdesktop ec2-54-152-45-128.compute-1.amazonaws.com
Autoselected keyboard map fr
Connection established using SSL.
WARNING: Remote desktop does not support colour depth 24; falling back to 16
----

This should quite slowly finally show the following screen:

* On the AWS _Connect To Your Instance_ dialog open previously, click on the _Get Password_ button.
* Select the `.pem` file discussed above.

* and click _Decrypt Password_.
  You should now see the plain-text value of the password to connect to the instance.

NOTE: I don't know if this is specific to my environment, but if you're lucky enough like me, copy-paste will not work.
So I had to manually copy paste the value...
Cumbersome with that password length.

* Type `Administrator` and the password above on the logon screen.

Hope this helps!
