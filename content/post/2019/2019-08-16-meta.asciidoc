I want to go back to writing.
I am convinced that writing helps taking things out and is a good exercise by itself.

The frequency of postings here has gone way too low for my taste.

*With this entry, I am publicly committing to publish at least one entry per week during September 2019*.
footnote:[Yeah, not implying there are people out there actually caring about my commitment, but using this way to somehow force myself to not forget.]

Many things are ongoing on a personal and professional level that make blogging harder, but clearly that is also mostly a bad excuse.
I definitely spend enough time on things that are unimportant to me (Twitter and YouTube, looking at you) that I can recycle some of this time to blog instead.

Given my career change, and that I have also been reading more lately, I expect overall this should provide good matter for reflection, and hence blogging.

This will somehow by definition be less technical, but I will also keep talking about my various technical findings.
For instance, after the closing of CrashPlan for personal use, I have spent a fair amount of time experimenting various backup solutions a few months ago.
This is now running incrementally in the background every 15 minutes, using link:https://restic.net[Restic].

Stay tuned and see you soon! :-)
